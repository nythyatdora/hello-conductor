# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a newly initialized Git repository named "hello-conductor" with no source code files yet. The repository currently contains only the Git metadata (.git directory).

## Current State

- Empty repository with only initial commit
- No package.json, source files, or configuration files present
- No build system, dependencies, or development tools configured
- No existing code architecture to document

## Next Steps for Development

Since this is an empty repository, future development will need to establish:
- Project structure and files
- Build system and package management
- Development workflow and commands
- Code architecture patterns

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated once the project structure and development environment are established.
